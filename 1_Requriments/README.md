***WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM***

This Wiper Speed Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its primary function is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen.
Because driving a vehicle in the rain is quite difficult, we will use wipers to clear the front screen of the vehicle, which is a mirror, so that we may drive the vehicle even in the rain.

**WORKING PROCESS**

  -When the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be on Ignition mode.

  -When the button is pressed THREE times, wiper turn on.

  -When the button is pressed FOUR times, wiper turn off.
